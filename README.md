This repository provides a comprehensive comparison of various RF and optical modulation schemes across three key performance indicators: Bit Error Rate (BER), Peak-to-Average Power Ratio (PAPR), and Spectral Efficiency (SE).

📊 Modulation Schemes Compared
RF Modulation Schemes:
OFDM - Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing
OFDM-IM - OFDM with Index Modulation
OCDM - Orthogonal Chirp Division Multiplexing
SCMA - Sparse Code Multiple Access
OTFS - Orthogonal Time Frequency Space

Optical Modulation Schemes:
O-OFDM - Optical OFDM
O-OTFS - Optical OTFS
O-OCDM - Optical OCDM
O-OFDM-IM - Optical OFDM with Index Modulation
O-SCMA - Optical SCMA

📈 Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
The performance evaluation is based on three critical metrics:
Bit Error Rate (BER): Probability of error in the received bits
Peak-to-Average Power Ratio (PAPR): Ratio of peak power to average power
Spectral Efficiency (SE): Data rate transmitted over a given bandwidth
